# The more general way to combine elements, and the most flexible, is with a class that inherits from CombineFn.
# CombineFn.create_accumulator(): This creates an empty accumulator. For example, an empty accumulator for a sum would be 0, while an empty accumulator for a product (multiplication) would be 1.
# CombineFn.add_input(): Called once per element. Takes an accumulator and an input element, combines them and returns the updated accumulator.
# CombineFn.merge_accumulators(): Multiple accumulators could be processed in parallel, so this function helps merging them into a single accumulator.
# CombineFn.extract_output(): It allows to do additional calculations before extracting a result.
